Very basic implementation of the FrontpageController Pattern in PHP.

Take a look at the indexController! It's a nice example how to use it!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Define a Controller:
Add all your Controllers in the controller/ dir. Name Guideline is <controllername>Controller.php

Example: controller/testController.php 

Example of a Controller:

<?php
class testController
{
  public function init($request)
  {
      echo "I'm the Init";
  }

  public function hiAction()
  {
    echo "I'm the hiAction";
  }

}

Right after the Controller is initialized, the init() Function will be called. As Parameter, it gets the whole http Request, splitted by POST and GET.

$request['post'] = // All the POST Stuff will go here
$request['get'] = // All the GET Stuff will go here


Actions are Named exactly like in Zend:
<actionName>Action(). In my Example: hiAction().

If no Action is set, the indexAction will be called
If no Controller is set, the indexController will be called

To call your Controller with the Browser, navigate to your index.php and add the 'controller' and 'action' Parameter.

Example:
index.php?controller=test&action=hi

(Add a mod_rewrite for your specification :))



The 404.html will be called, when a not-existing Controller is called
